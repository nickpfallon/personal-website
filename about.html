	    <h3>Introduction</h3>
	    <p>Hello, my name is Nick Fallon. I am a 23-year-old from Arvada, CO. I graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder in May of 2015 with a degree in Quantitative Economics and a minor in Math.  I realized my interest in programming shortly after graduation and began slowly learning a number of different programming languages from there.</p>

	    <h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>

		<p>My primary interest, since I was a child, has always been in computers.  Some of my earliest memories involve playing childrens' computer games on my dad's old CRT monitor.  I built my first gaming computer when I was 14.  I probably spent an unhealthy amount of time on the computer during my childhood, but I don't regret it because it strengthened my friendships and helped get me to where I am today.  One of my favorite things about computers is what they allow me to do with math.</p>
		<p>I've also always been interested in art.  I took quite a few art classes in high school.  I've worked with many types of media, but painting is what I do the most of now.  I don't spend nearly as much time painting now as I probably should, but I haven't lost my artistic side.</p>

	    <h3>Family and Hometown</h3>
		<p>I was born in Jacksonville, FL, but my family moved to the Denver area when I was about 4 years old to be closer to my mom's side of the family.  I grew up in Arvada, CO, which is a western suburb of Denver, and went to Ralston Valley High School in northwestern Arvada.  I have one sister who is about 2 years younger than me.  Both of my parents went to engineering school, and my sister is currently finishing her last semester at Colorado School of Mines.</p>
