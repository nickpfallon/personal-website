	    <h3>Education</h3>
		<p>I never really had the intention to go to graduate school, but I wanted to further my education.  I don't feel that what I studied in undergrad is really where my true interests lie, and I realized when I started doing more programming after college that I may have found a calling.  I'm excited to begin learning about the many intricacies of web development at Galvanize, where I believe my strengths can really shine through my work.</p>

	    <h3>Career</h3>
		<p>I decided to study at Galvanize so that I will have a highly employable skillset relevant to a field that I believe will give me real career satisfaction.  I'm still not sure exactly where I want to start my new career, but I have a few ideas:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li><b>Video streaming services</b> like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube are continuing to rise in popularity so much that the market is shifting away from cable television and physical DVDs. I use them every day, and I love their dynamic nature</li>
		  <li><b>Social media</b> is quite literally revolutionizing the world, and I would love to be a part of that revolution.</li>
		  <li>Working for a <b>startup</b> would give me the opportunity to help a smaller business grow and see more of the full picture of a business.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I'm open to a lot of ideas, and I'm excited to see where my path leads.</p>

	    <h3>Life</h3>
		<p>One of my long-term dreams is to live abroad and travel.  I'm particularly drawn to South America and Southeast Asia.  I've lived in Colorado for almost my entire life, and I would love to experience more. I love experiencing new cultures and learning new languages.  I think having the skills of a web developer would provide me with a great opportunity to be able to accomplish that goal because web developers are valuable in every industry in almost every part of the world.</p>
